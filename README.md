Powerlifting Calculator Python

This project is a quick project made by me (teig)!

It was mainly for me testing around with how dictionary and list work together. You definitely don't have to use dictionary and list combined to make a calculator like this, but it was nice to use this to learn how they work together, and how to make a dictionary to a list. This project is also not completely done (for example, checking if the values are int etc.)
